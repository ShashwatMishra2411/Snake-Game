# Snake-Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, eating food and growing longer. The objective is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the screen or the snake's own body.

# How to Play
Use the keyboard arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.

The snake will move in the direction specified by the arrow keys.

The goal is to eat the food that appears on the screen.

Each time the snake eats food, it grows longer.

The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries or its own body.

The longer the snake gets, the higher the score.

The game also keeps track of the highest score achieved.

# Dependencies
The Snake Game uses the Turtle module in Python, which provides a simple and intuitive way to create graphics and animations. It doesn't require any additional libraries or modules to run.

# Controls
- Use the W key to move the snake up.
- Use the S key to move the snake down.
- Use the A key to move the snake left.
- Use the D key to move the snake right.
- Press ESC to exit the game.
